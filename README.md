## Material-Design Colorpalette light-blue/red

I chose to use [materialpalette.com/light-blue/red](https://www.materialpalette.com/light-blue/red) as the base colorpalette.
As the css export is broken at the time of writing (last checked: 2016-12-17), here are those values:

 * Dark Primary Color:  #0288D1
 * Primary Color:       #03A9F4
 * Light Primary Color: #B3E5FC
 * Text/Icons:          #FFFFFF
 * Accent Color:        #FF5252
 * Primary Text:        #212121
 * Secondary Text:      #757575
 * Divider Color:       #BDBDBD
