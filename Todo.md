> Quick list of things in the back of my head. Written down so I don't forget them

 * Clean up everything not needed anymore (results, resultsToMovieArray, etc.)
 * Split rate reducer into combined reducer personalMovieList and processes
 * Remove "this" from components as much as possible
 * Write tests for new components
 * Finish implementation of iterateBinarySearch
 * Add Component+Container to be able to change the sort criteria
 * Idea: Pre-computing for videodb.xml, strip all lines not needed
